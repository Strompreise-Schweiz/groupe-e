# Groupe E Electricity Data

This repository provides **open electricity data** for [Groupe E](./data/supplier.json).  It is part of the [Strompreise Schweiz](https://www.strompreise-schweiz.ch) initiative.

## Contents

- **`/data`**  
  JSON files containing detailed information about the electricity supplier, its tariffs, and prices.

- **`/assets`**  
  Supplier logo and related visual assets.

All data is structured in a machine-readable way to support integration with external applications and services.

## Data Validation

Every dataset is automatically validated against the  
[`supplier-data-validation`](https://github.com/Strompreise-Schweiz/supplier-data-validation) schemas using GitHub Actions. This ensures consistent structure and reliable data quality across suppliers.

## Usage

The data can be freely used for:

- Research and analysis  
- Integration into applications and services  
- Visualizations and comparisons  

If you build something cool with it, we’d love to hear about it!
